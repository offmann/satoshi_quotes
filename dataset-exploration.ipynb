I hope there's not a big hurry to wrap the discussion and decide.  How long does Wikipedia typically leave a question like that open for comment? \\nIt would help to condense the article and make it less promotional sounding as soon as possible.  Just letting people know what it is, where it fits into the electronic money space, not trying to convince them that it's good.  They probably want something that just generally identifies what it is, not tries to explain all about how it works.  \n",

You can't get it back, but if you could, if it had a kill switch that could be remote triggered, would you do it?  Would it be a good thing for thieves to know that everything you own has a kill switch and if they steal it, it'll be useless to them, although you still lose it too?  If they give it back, you can re-activate it.\\nImagine if gold turned to lead when stolen.  If the thief gives it back, it turns to gold again.\\nIt still seems to me the problem may be one of presenting it the right way.  For one thing, not being so blunt about \"money burning\" for the purposes of game theory discussion.  The money is never truly burned.  You have the option to release it at any time forever.  \n",
